If you would like to contribute please follow these simple rules:

1. Write clean code. Try to follow the style in the other layers here.
2. Make sure you own or have the right to contribute the code you provide.
3. Add any needed unit tests in the `test` directory. We use [qunit](http://qunitjs.com/). All you have to do to run the tests is open the `test.html` file in your web browser.
